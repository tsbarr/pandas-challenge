    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the analysis of the district's schools and the math and reading scores of their students, I can draw several conclusions, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **District vs Charter:** the school type has an effect on the grades of the students. Charter schools have a higher average score for both math and reading. Also, the percentage of students passing math, reading and both is way higher in charter schools (93.6%, 96.6%, 90.4%, respectively) than in district schools (66.5%, 80.8%, 53.7%, respectively). Another notable detail is that when we look at the performance of the schools by the percentage of students that passed both math and reading, the top 5 schools are all charter schools and the bottom 5 are all district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **School size:** we see a big drop in performance in large schools (2000-5000 students) compared to medium (1000-2000 students) and small (less than 1000 students) sized schools. The overall passing percentage in large school is 58.3%, compared to 90.6% in medium schools and 89.9% in small schools. This seems to be mostly affected by math, since the percentage of students that passed this subject is 93.6%, 93.6% and 69.96% in small, medium and large schools respectively, compared to percentage of passing reading which is 96.1%, 96.8% and 82.8% in small, medium and large schools, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Spending per student:** we also see a drop in overall passing percentage as budget per student increases, with percentage of overall passing going from 90.4% in schools that spend less than $585 per student to 53.5% in schools that spend $645-680 per student.\n"
